# Man_G EQ Volume

Just download ManGVE.rar or clone the whole Repo, and extract it to your VST's folder and launch your DAW. Scan effects and you'll find it in your effects mixer slot.

It just an a simple linear EQ ranges from 20hz to 20k, developed by me using Visual  Studio and RackAFX technology, if you also interested on audio plugin development with C++. RackAFX is the best start because is much easy, download it here:->"http://www.willpirkle.com/" and the owner have outstanding tutorials on youtube. But you have to be able understanding C++ basics/main project.

From Goitse aka:->Man G!
Enjoy!
